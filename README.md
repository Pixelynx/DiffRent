DiffRent is an application that is meant to improve the ability for landlords and tenants to communicate with one another. It will include payment tracking features to keep track of each payment a tenant has made It will also include a form of helpdesk and support ticketing so when a tenant has an issue within the household, they can easily submit a ticket to the landlord. This will get rid of the issue some may have experienced with trying to get a hold of the landlord to fix issues and not being able to reach them due to them being busy handling other matters. Additionally, there will be a feature for landlords and tenants to give ratings and comments on one another to help landlords have a better idea of how a potential tenant will be, as well as allows housing-seekers get an idea of how their potential landlord will be before settling on a place to live. This could also potentionally help those without credit have an easier time finding a place [if they have positive ratings through the app] without being restricted by their lack of credit. This app will be able to accomplish the following:

* Sign in/up functionality
* The ability to choose between being a tenant or landlord
* Reminder of when rent is due
* Notice of when rent is late (lateness fee)
* Tenant functionalities will include:
  * Profile page
  * Paying rent
  * Submitting tickets
  * Setting up/rescheduling appointments for landlord visits
  * Submitting notice of leave from the home
  * Submitting ratings and comments for specific landlords
* Landlord functionalities will include:
  * Profile page
  * List of current tenants
  * Setting up notice for when specific a tenant's rent is due
  * Confirming rent payment with invoice feature
  * Setting up/rescheduling appointments for visits to apartments
